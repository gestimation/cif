Description: This package provides a compact and unified toolkit for survival and competing risks analysis in R. It covers both nonparametric estimation and regression modeling of cumulative incidence functions (CIFs). cif_curve() estimates and visualizes Kaplan–Meier survival or Aalen–Johansen cumulative incidence curves with a familiar survival::survfit object. cif_reg() performs regression modeling of counting process based on polytomous log-odds products and stratified IPCW estimator and estimates risk ratios, odds ratios, or subdistribution hazard ratios of a categorical exposure. Both functions adopt a formula + data syntax, return tidy, publication-ready outputs, and integrate seamlessly with ggsurvfit and modelsummary for visualization. Key numerical routines are implemented in C++ via 'Rcpp'.
